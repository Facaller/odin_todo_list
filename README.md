# 🗂️ Odin Todo List

**Live Demo:** [View on GitHub Pages](https://facaller.github.io/odin_todo_list/)

A modular, JavaScript-based todo list app inspired by Jira’s project management structure. This was my first major application and represents a significant learning milestone. It includes task creation, project grouping, and basic state persistence using `localStorage`.

The UI is styled with a philosophical theme, drawing inspiration from the myth of Sisyphus — symbolizing the endless nature of task lists. Icons like scrolls, hourglasses, and yin-yang symbols reflect this theme with a minimal, antiquated aesthetic.

## 🚀 Features

- Create, edit, and delete todos
- Group todos under different projects
- Save data locally using `localStorage`
- Modular architecture using ES6 modules and classes

## 🎯 Purpose

This app was built to deepen my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, DOM manipulation, and project architecture. The goal was to simulate the basic structure of a project management tool like Jira—ambitious for a beginner, but a valuable experience in complexity and problem-solving.

## 🛠️ Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Webpack

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- Handling data structures and app state manually
- Applying SOLID principles in a small codebase
- Modular design patterns and separation of concerns
- How difficult it actually is to build real-world apps (and why Jira has an entire engineering team!)

## 📦 Setup

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run build` and open `dist/index.html` in your browser

## 🔍 Future Improvements

- Better drag-and-drop UI
- Due dates and priority filtering
- Mobile responsiveness
- Improved UX and accessibility
