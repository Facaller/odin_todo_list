Thanks for providing the updated code! The issue you're describing—where the submit button becomes clickable but the form doesn't submit—suggests there might still be something missing in how the event is being handled or how the form is being submitted.

Let’s troubleshoot and go through a few possible solutions:

Potential Issues:
Form Handling and Event Propagation: It's crucial to ensure that you’re correctly stopping the form’s default behavior when clicking the submit button.

Binding Methods: While you’ve correctly added event.preventDefault() and called submitProjectForm, there could be a mismatch in how the methods are invoked or how the event is propagated.

The Form's submit Button: Since the submit button is being clicked, but the form still doesn’t submit, we need to confirm that the event listener is correctly set up and that the method submitProjectForm is being called.

What we’ll do:
Make sure the form isn’t getting submitted unintentionally.

Ensure that submitProjectForm is called correctly.

Double-check that the event listeners are correctly set up.

Try this approach:
Double-check the submit event: Even if you're using a button with click, if there's a <form> element wrapping the inputs, the form might still try to submit automatically. Using a submit event handler on the form can be more reliable than attaching it directly to the button.

Use submit on the form: Instead of attaching the click event directly to the button, you could attach a submit event listener to the form itself. This would help ensure that the form is handled consistently.

Update the Code as follows:
1. Modify bindProjectFormSubmit:
Instead of listening to the button's click event, listen for the form’s submit event. This makes it easier to handle the form submission reliably.

js
Copy
bindProjectFormSubmit = () => {
    const projectForm = this.elements.projectForm.querySelector('form');
    projectForm.addEventListener('input', () => {
        // Disable the submit button when the form is invalid
        this.elements.submitProject.disabled = !this.isFormValid(this.elements.projectTitle, this.elements.projectDetails);
    });

    // Handle form submission
    projectForm.addEventListener('submit', (event) => {
        event.preventDefault();  // Prevent default form submission behavior
        this.submitProjectForm(event);  // Handle the submit manually
    });
}
2. Modify submitProjectForm method:
The method submitProjectForm should still be triggered when the form is submitted manually. Since you are now handling the submit event, the form won't try to reload the page, so just ensure the logic works properly.

js
Copy
submitProjectForm (event) {
    event.preventDefault();  // Ensure no page reload
    const projectForm = this.elements.projectForm;
    const form = projectForm.querySelector('form');

    if (this.isFormValid(this.elements.projectTitle, this.elements.projectDetails)) {
        if (this.editProject) {
            this.submitEditedProjectForm();
        } else {
            const newProject = this.getProjectValues();
            this.tasklist.addTask(newProject);
            this.renderProject();
        }
        form.reset();  // Reset form after submission
        this.elements.projectForm.classList.toggle('hidden');
    }
}
Explanation of Changes:
submit event: I changed the submit logic to use the submit event for the form instead of the button. This allows the form submission to be handled more reliably (and avoids issues with the button's click event).

event.preventDefault(): This stops the form from submitting in the default way (which causes a page reload).

form.reset(): After submission, we reset the form inputs to their initial state, as you're doing already.

Checking Form Validity: The submit button will only be enabled when the form is valid (i.e., both the title and details fields are non-empty), which you’ve already set up correctly in the input event handler.

Final Flow:
When the user fills in the form, the submit button will be enabled when both fields are valid.

When the user clicks submit, it prevents the default form behavior (e.g., page reload) and manually triggers submitProjectForm.

If the form is valid, it either adds a new project or updates the existing project, then resets and hides the form.

Bonus: Debugging Tips:
Console logs: Place console.log statements in your submitProjectForm method to check if it's being called correctly.

js
Copy
submitProjectForm (event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    console.log("Form submitted!");
    // rest of your code...
}
Check for Errors: Open your browser’s Developer Tools (usually F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I) and check the Console tab for any errors that might be preventing the form submission from working as expected.
