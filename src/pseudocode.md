hanks for sharing the HTML! From reviewing both the HTML and DOMHandler modules, there are a few things that might be causing the event listeners not to fire as expected:

1. Missing Event Listeners Binding
The issue might be that you're not binding the event listeners for the sidebar buttons, project buttons, or main content buttons in your constructor or some initialization function. You need to ensure that you call the necessary binding methods inside your app's startup code.

For example, the bindSidebarButtons(), bindProjectButtons(), and bindMainContentButtons() methods are responsible for adding the event listeners to the buttons and should be called when initializing your app.

Try adding these method calls in the constructor of DOMHandler:

javascript
Copy
constructor(tasklist) {
    this.tasklist = tasklist;
    this.elements = new DOMElements();
    this.renderedTasks = [];
    this.editTodo = null;
    this.editProject = null;

    this.bindSidebarButtons();
    this.bindProjectButtons();
    this.bindMainContentButtons();
    this.bindProjectFormButtons();
    this.bindTodoFormButtons();
}
2. Check if the DOM Elements are Loaded
Another potential issue is that your JavaScript might be running before the DOM is fully loaded, especially if you're using an external script. Make sure your <script> tag is placed at the end of the <body> or that you're waiting for the DOM to be ready (e.g., using DOMContentLoaded event) before attaching event listeners.

Hereâ€™s an example of ensuring the DOM is ready:

javascript
Copy
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    const domHandler = new DOMHandler(tasklist);  // Initialize DOMHandler after DOM is ready
});
3. Ensure Element Selectors Are Correct
You are using document.querySelector to select elements like .sidebar, .main-content, etc. Make sure the corresponding elements in your HTML file match those class names or IDs exactly. From the HTML you provided, they do seem to match, but if there's any typo or mismatch in your code, event listeners won't work.

4. Targeting Buttons in Dynamic Elements
Since the buttons (like addProject, submitProject, etc.) are inside elements that might be dynamically created, make sure you're correctly using event delegation. For instance, when you click on buttons inside dynamically rendered projects or todos, they need to be captured by event delegation rather than direct event listeners (which it seems you're already doing in most cases).

For example, inside bindSidebarButtons(), you're correctly checking if the button exists in the sidebar. Ensure you're using the .closest() method effectively to check for buttons within the correct containers.

Debugging Strategy
Add Logging: Add console.log() inside each of the event handlers (like bindSidebarButtons() and bindProjectButtons()) to confirm whether they're firing.

Check Selector Match: Use console.log() to ensure the sidebarNav, sidebarProjects, mainContent, etc., elements are being properly selected by querySelector.

Try Manual Clicks: You can try manually adding a click event listener to one of the static buttons directly in the console, like so:

javascript
Copy
document.querySelector('#allTasks').addEventListener('click', () => console.log('Clicked All Tasks'));
If this works, it will indicate that event listeners aren't properly attached via the DOMHandler.
