It looks like the issue is that the image path is not being resolved correctly, leading to a 404 error (the image can't be found).

Why This Is Happening:
Webpack handles assets differently, and when you reference an image directly with a relative path like ./assets/images/sculpture.png, Webpack might not know how to handle that properly.

The image path should be resolved relative to the output directory after Webpack processes your files. In other words, Webpack needs to know where to find those images when building the project for the browser.

How to Fix This:
You need to use Webpack’s handling of static assets to ensure that the images are correctly bundled and referenced. The images should be located in the correct directory within the dist folder after Webpack compiles your project.

Solution:
Using url-loader or file-loader (Webpack Asset Modules): You can modify your webpack.config.js to handle static assets correctly.

Update Image Paths: Ensure you're using the correct path when referencing images in your code, considering Webpack's handling of assets.

Steps:
1. Update webpack.config.js
You already have the right setup in your webpack.config.js, but let’s make sure everything is set correctly to handle images.

javascript
Copy
module.exports = {
    mode: "development",
    entry: "./src/index.js",
    output: {
        filename: "main.js",
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),
        clean: true,
        assetModuleFilename: 'assets/images/[name][ext][query]'  // Add this line to specify how assets should be output
    },
    devtool: "eval-source-map",
    devServer: {
        watchFiles: ["./src/index.html"],
    },
    plugins: [
        new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
        template: "./src/index.html",
        }),
    ],
    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.css$/i,
                use: ["style-loader", "css-loader"],
            },
            {
                test: /\.html$/i,
                loader: "html-loader",
            },
            {
                test: /\.(png|svg|jpg|jpeg|gif)$/i,
                type: "asset/resource",  // Webpack asset resource handling
            },
            {
                test: /\.(woff|woff2)$/i,
                type: "asset/resource",
                generator: {
                    filename: "assets/fonts/[name][ext][query]",
                },
            },
        ],
    },
};
2. Correct Image Path in HTML/JS:
Instead of manually using relative paths like ./assets/images/sculpture.png, use Webpack's asset module to resolve the correct URL dynamically. Modify your getProjectImageSrc method to ensure the images are bundled correctly:

javascript
Copy
getProjectImageSrc (prioID) {
    const imageSources = {
        contemplativePrio: require('./assets/images/sculpture.png'),  // Use require for image import
        pragmaticPrio:     require('./assets/images/hard-work.png'),
        imperativePrio:    require('./assets/images/whip.png')
    };
    return imageSources[prioID] || require('./assets/images/default.png');  // Fallback image
}
This will tell Webpack to bundle and resolve the image paths correctly during the build process. The require function will ensure that Webpack processes the images and outputs them in the dist folder.

3. Rebuild Your Project:
After making these changes to webpack.config.js and the code that references the images, make sure to rebuild your project.

Run the following command to rebuild your project:

bash
Copy
npm run build
Then, restart the development server:

bash
Copy
npm run dev
4. Update HTML img Tags (Optional):
If you want to verify that the image paths are being handled correctly, you can log the src of the image elements when they are being set:

javascript
Copy
projectImg.src = this.getProjectImageSrc(project.priority);
console.log('Image source:', projectImg.src);  // Log to check the final path
div.appendChild(projectImg);
This will help you see the actual path Webpack is using to resolve the image.

Summary of Changes:
Use require() to import images dynamically when working with Webpack.

Make sure your webpack.config.js handles asset resources correctly.

Rebuild your project to make sure all assets are processed and bundled.
