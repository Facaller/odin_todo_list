Based on the error you're seeing, it looks like there is an issue with how the project is being passed and handled in the Todo constructor. Specifically, the error messages:

"Project does not exist" (from projects.js:37)
"Project not found" (from todos.js:16)
indicate that your Todo is unable to find the associated Project. Let's walk through your index.js and see why this might be happening.

Your index.js File
js
Copy code
import "./styles.css"
import { Todo, TodoList } from "./todos.js";
import { Project } from "./projects.js";

// Creating a project
const project = new Project("Build website", "Create a personal portfolio", "Complete");

// Creating a todo, passing the project title
const todo = new Todo("Buy groceries", "Milk, eggs, bread", "2024-12-01", project.title);

// Creating a TodoList
const todolist = new TodoList();
Key Points to Consider:
Creating the Project:

You correctly create a Project instance:
js
Copy code
const project = new Project("Build website", "Create a personal portfolio", "Complete");
Creating the Todo:

You're passing the project.title to the Todo constructor:
js
Copy code
const todo = new Todo("Buy groceries", "Milk, eggs, bread", "2024-12-01", project.title);
This means you're passing the title of the project ("Build website") to the Todo constructor.
The Core Issue:
The error messages you’re seeing suggest that the Todo class isn't finding the project when it tries to access it via ProjectList.getProjectID(projectTitle).

Why the Error Happens:
In your Todo constructor, you're using ProjectList.getProjectID(projectTitle) to find the project. However, this assumes that ProjectList already contains the project you're passing ("Build website").
The issue is that you're not adding your newly created Project instance to the ProjectList anywhere in the code. Therefore, when getProjectID is called with the project.title, it can't find it in the list of projects.
How to Fix It:
Add the Project to the ProjectList: You need to add your project instance to an instance of ProjectList. Here's how you can fix it:
Step 1: Modify index.js to Add the Project to ProjectList
You should create an instance of ProjectList and add the project to it. Then, pass the projectList instance to your Todo.

js
Copy code
import "./styles.css";
import { Todo, TodoList } from "./todos.js";
import { Project, ProjectList } from "./projects.js";  // Import ProjectList

// Create an instance of ProjectList
const projectList = new ProjectList();

// Create a project and add it to the projectList
const project = new Project("Build website", "Create a personal portfolio", "Complete");
projectList.add(project);  // Assuming you have an `add()` method in `ProjectList`

// Create a Todo and pass the project title
const todo = new Todo("Buy groceries", "Milk, eggs, bread", "2024-12-01", project.title);

// Create a TodoList
const todolist = new TodoList();
Step 2: Ensure ProjectList has an add method
If ProjectList does not yet have an add method to add projects to the list, you can add it. Here's how to implement it in projects.js:

js
Copy code
export class ProjectList extends TaskList {
    constructor() {
        super();
    }

    add(project) {
        this.tasks.push(project);  // Assuming `tasks` is the array where you store projects
    }

    getProjectID(projectTitle) {
        const project = this.tasks.find(task => task.title === projectTitle);

        if (!project) {
            console.log('Project does not exist');
            return null;
        }
        return project.id;
    }
}
Recap:
The main issue is that your ProjectList doesn’t have the project instance added to it, so getProjectID can’t find the project when searching for the title.
To fix this, create an instance of ProjectList, add the project to it (using the add method), and pass the project.title to the Todo constructor.
