___The issue___

- The render methods are loops, so I can't add new methods individually.
- Should probably make them single methods and add a separate method for rendering all tasks.
-Won't be going with state-tracking, but rather with visibility changes to make things easier.
Disable add todo & project buttons unless All Tasks state is in action
