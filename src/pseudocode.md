Why Move updateTodo to TodoList?
The updateTodo function needs to handle updating a todo in the list of todos, which is the responsibility of the TodoList class. Since a todo is just an individual object with properties like title, details, and date, and the TodoList is responsible for managing the collection of todos, it makes sense for updateTodo to:

Locate the specific todo in the list by its id.
Update the todo's properties once it’s located.
Keep the logic of managing the list (finding, updating, removing, etc.) centralized in the TodoList class.
Here’s how the logic would flow:
The TodoList will manage all todos. It should be the central place where you add, remove, and update todos.
The updateTodo function in TodoList will:
Find the todo by its unique id.
Update the specific todo's properties (e.g., title, details, date).
If necessary, validate the changes (e.g., using the validateTodo method from the Todo class).
The Todo class will just represent the data for an individual todo. It doesn't need to handle the list of todos or the updating of the list. It can be focused on encapsulating the properties and validation for a single todo item.
Structuring updateTodo in TodoList
Your TodoList will have a method like updateTodo(id, newTitle, newDetails, newDate) which does the following:

Find the todo by its id.
Update the properties (title, details, and date).
Optionally, validate the new values using the validateTodo method from Todo before applying the changes.
Example Workflow (In terms of classes):
TodoList class has the list of all todos and is responsible for operations like addTodo, removeTodo, and updateTodo.
Todo class represents the individual todo items and validates their inputs.
Example Update Method Flow:
The TodoList class method updateTodo:

Accepts parameters for the new todo values (e.g., newTitle, newDetails, newDate).
Locates the todo by id within the this.todos array.
Optionally, you can call validateTodo for each field (e.g., to ensure that the title and details match the validation pattern).
Updates the properties of the located todo.
How updateTodo in TodoList works:

If the todo exists (found by id), update its properties.
If you want to be sure that validateTodo works properly, you can either:
Call validateTodo before the update (in TodoList), or
Ensure Todo objects themselves handle validation when you create new todos or update them.
Things to Consider:
Partial Updates: If you're updating only certain properties (for example, only the title), you can pass those properties to the updateTodo method and leave the rest unchanged. Make sure your method accounts for this flexibility.

Validation: You may want to call validateTodo inside updateTodo to ensure the inputs are valid before making the change. If the validation fails, you should handle it (e.g., return a message or prevent the update).

Example Sketch of updateTodo in TodoList:
Here’s a conceptual approach to how you could structure your updateTodo function:

The method accepts an id and updated properties.
It finds the todo by id.
It validates the new values (if necessary).
It updates the todo.
In Summary:
Move updateTodo to TodoList because it's responsible for managing the collection of todos.
The updateTodo method will:
Accept parameters for updated values.
Locate the todo by its id.
Update the todo’s properties.
Optionally, validate the updated values.
This approach keeps the Todo class focused on representing the data for an individual todo (and handling validation for each todo), while the TodoList class takes care of the collection and operations on the list of todos.
