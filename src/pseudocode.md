Changes Made So Far (Good Practices):
Event delegation:

In methods like bindSidebarButtons, bindTodoButtons, removeProject, deleteProject, and others, you're using event delegation by attaching a listener to a parent element and then checking for the target. This approach is efficient because it avoids multiple individual event listeners and ensures that dynamically created elements are also handled.
Reusability:

You're using a DOMElements class to store and access DOM elements, which makes your code more modular and maintainable.
Areas to Focus on:
Event Listeners for Dynamic Content:

For elements that are dynamically added, you need to ensure that event listeners are added correctly. For example, in createProjectForMain and createTodo, you create new elements like buttons and divs. These elements need event listeners added after they are created.
You're doing this well in most cases, but make sure that buttons inside dynamically added elements (like "edit" or "delete" buttons) get their respective event listeners as well. For example, after creating a project or todo, add a listener for events like "edit" or "delete". Use delegation for handling this dynamically:
javascript
Copy
div.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
    const editBtn = event.target.closest('.edit-project-btn');
    if (editBtn) {
        // handle edit project
    }
});
Handling the projectImage in updateProjectDOM:

In the updateProjectDOM method, it seems like you want to update the image based on the priority (contingent on the priority ID). However, you're assigning this.projectImage directly without setting an img element. You need to locate the image element in the project and update its src accordingly.
javascript
Copy
if (prioID === 'contemplativePrio') {
    project.querySelector('.project-img').src = 'path/to/contemplative/image.png';
} else if (prioID === 'pragmaticPrio') {
    project.querySelector('.project-img').src = 'path/to/pragmatic/image.png';
} else if (prioID === 'imperativePrio') {
    project.querySelector('.project-img').src = 'path/to/imperative/image.png';
}
Using querySelectorAll for multiple elements:

In getPriorityID(), you're using this.projectPrio (which is an array-like NodeList). While youâ€™re iterating through it using a for loop, remember that NodeList can be converted to an array for better compatibility and functionality. It's safer to use Array.from(this.projectPrio) or simply use .forEach() if you prefer. Here's an example of the change:
javascript
Copy
getPriorityID() {
    const prioID = Array.from(this.projectPrio).find(radio => radio.checked);
    return prioID ? prioID.id : null;
}
Handling Events in showHideOptionsProject and showHideOptionsTodo:

In showHideOptionsProject and showHideOptionsTodo, the logic for hiding and showing options is correct, but it might break if you hide the options while you're still interacting with the button. Consider using event delegation (similar to other event handlers) to manage this better.
Resetting the forms:

In submitProjectForm and submitTodoForm, you're resetting the forms (this.elements.projectForm.reset() and this.elements.todoForm.reset()) after submission. Make sure that this doesn't interfere with user experience when they want to continue editing the form after submission. If the user is editing, make sure they get a chance to update the fields before resetting.
Error Handling and Validation:

You don't seem to be doing much form validation (checking whether fields are empty before submitting). I suggest adding basic validation in submitProjectForm and submitTodoForm to ensure that the user doesn't submit incomplete data:
javascript
Copy
if (!newTitle || !newDetails) {
    alert('Please fill in all required fields.');
    return;
}
Minor Mistake in updateTodoDOM:

You have an issue with accessing dateElement inside the updateTodoDOM method. You're using todo.this.todoDate, which will result in an error because this is incorrect in that context. The correct way is:
javascript
Copy
const dateElement = todo.querySelector('.todo-date');
if (dateElement) {
    dateElement.textContent = date;
}
Make sure that the date element exists in the DOM before trying to update its content.
Additional Suggestions:
Consistency in Naming:
Be consistent with how you name event handlers. You have both handleShowProject and showProject, for instance. Consider renaming showProject to bindShowProject if it is intended to set up event listeners.
Refactor DOM Manipulation:
You've done great with separating concerns, but ensure you're using classList more than style whenever possible for showing/hiding elements. For example:
javascript
Copy
moreOptions.classList.toggle('hidden');
You can then define a .hidden { display: none; } style in CSS. This makes your code more consistent and keeps CSS concerns separate from JavaScript logic.
Conclusion:
Overall, you are on the right track, and your changes are improving your code. Focus on handling dynamic content properly, ensuring that event listeners are set up for newly created elements, and adding validation to your forms. Also, be careful when updating the DOM to avoid referencing incorrect elements or missing required checks.
